# review_symb_regression
Symbolic regression represents an innovative approach to artificial intelligence, which can be considered an evolution of the scientific method used by Kepler, when he carried out mathematical analysis based on trial and error.

Today, with an increasingly robust set of tools, symbolic regression models cover a wide variety of methods, from genetic algorithms to advanced machine learning techniques. Among the algorithms implemented in Python and accessible on open source platforms, there are five that have gained significant attention in the academic community: GPLearn, AI-Feynman, PySINDy, PySR and PyKAN.

This repository presents a concise introduction to these models and explores practical examples applied to data generated by the SIR system, which propagates in homogeneous networks. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of these models to recover the original structure of the dynamic system underlying the data.

This innovative approach to data analysis has the potential to revolutionize studies of epidemic systems, and it was precisely this perspective that motivated us to develop this research.
